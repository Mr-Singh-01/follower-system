## Setting up Docker

To facilitate the storage of data locally for testing the follower system, I utilise Docker. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Run the following command:

   npm run docker:up

This command will initiate the Docker container, allowing you to store data locally for testing purposes.

Running in Development Mode
Running your application in development mode is crucial for building and testing the follower system efficiently. Follow these steps to start your application in development mode:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Run the following command:

   npm run dev

This command will start your application in development mode, enabling you to make changes and test the follower system.

That's it! You are now ready to work on implementing the follower system for your social media application. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for support.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
